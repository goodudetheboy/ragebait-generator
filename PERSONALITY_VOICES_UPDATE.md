## 💡 Why This Is Better

### Old Approach
❌ Generic names (Elli, Rachel, Josh)  
❌ Boring descriptions (Natural, Pleasant)  
❌ Doesn't match ragebait vibe  
❌ No personality  

### New Approach
✅ **PERSONALITY-DRIVEN** descriptions  
✅ **ENGAGING** and on-brand  
✅ **CLEAR** what each voice does  
✅ **HILARIOUS** and memorable  
✅ **MARKETING GOLD** - people will try them all  

## 🔥 Marketing Copy

The new voice selector practically writes its own engagement:

> "Choose your villain:
> - UNHINGED & EMOTIONAL
> - CONDESCENDING & SEDUCTIVE  
> - ALPHA MALE ENERGY
> - VALLEY GIRL ENERGY
> - ASMR WHISPER CREEP
> - SMUG KNOW-IT-ALL
> - DEEP VOICE MANSPLAINER
> - BRITISH KAREN"

Each one is a CHARACTER, not just a voice.
